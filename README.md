# SportSync - Sports News and Calendar App

SportSync is a comprehensive sports application built with Vue.js, designed to deliver the latest sports news, manage event schedules, and provide a dynamic calendar interface similar to Google Calendar. With a clean and user-friendly interface, SportSync ensures users never miss an important match or event.

# Disclaimer:
This project was made to meet the requirements for a university course. Unfortunately, the code is a mess and disorganized due to the small time frame I had to make it work ( 48h ), therefore I incremented small fixes rather than long-term solutions. Soon if I decide to continue and expand on this project this disclaimer will be removed. If anyone is willing to contribute feel free.
